# View a list of alerts

The alert list interface is an important part of managing problems (wave, hardware, output) when the channel crashes. The interface in the list includes basic information about the alert such as start time, alert level, alert type,... and enables quick search, helping administrators manage issues and troubleshoot them promptly.

On the main screen of Media Live, select **Alerts** in the header tab.

The system home screen displays the alert list screen interface.

| **Level**       | The severity of an incident (warning) <br />There are 3 levels:<br />- **Critical**: The highest level of severity, which should be dealt with immediately to fix the problem and restore stability. <br />- **Major**: The severity is to a lesser extent than that of Critical, but still requires immediate intervention to prevent a negative impact on system operations.<br />\*\*Warning: the lowest severity, a warning usually indicates that there is a minor problem or a condition that could lead to a problem if not addressed. |
