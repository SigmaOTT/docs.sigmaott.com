- [App Management](#quản-storage-app)

## File

To view the user account information, perform the following steps:

1. On the sidebar, click the user icon with the user's email account.

By default, the personal information tab will display with the following information:

- **Email**: The email address has been validated (cannot be modified).

- **Phone**: Enter the phone number and display the prefix based on the selected country code.
- **Name**: Allows users to enter their name.

2. Click the field

In case the user makes no edits, clicking is still considered an edit action and the interface will allow editing.

After that, two buttons 'Save' and 'Cancel' will be activated so that users can save changes or cancel if they want to keep the current information without making any changes.

3. The user enters the information and clicks the 'Save' button.
4. The system saves the information and displays the message in the right corner of the screen

## Change password

Security information plays an important role in authenticating and protecting user accounts. To ensure your safety, you can change your password periodically after a period of use.

1. Switch tabs to change passwords

The interface will display with the following information:

- **Current Password**: Enter your current password to confirm your identity.
- **New Password**: Enter the new password, making sure that the new password is not the same as the old one.
- **Confirm New Password**: Re-enter the new password to ensure consistency and accuracy.

2. Enter the correct information

After filling in the information, click on the 'Save' button.

3. The system confirms, checks and saves your new password. You remain on the page and receive a success message in the right corner of the screen.

<!-- ![]() -->

_Notice: Password change successful!_

This not only enhances the security of your account, but also ensures that only the correct user can access it. The success message lets you know that the password change was done successfully and your new password has been updated in the system.
