# Remove membership

**Condition**: Must have at least one other member and be displayed in the member list.
**Actor**: The member is authorized to manage the application.

After creating the app and adding members, or when members no longer need to join, the administrator performs the removal of unnecessary members as follows:

**Step 1** :

At the main screen, the administrator selects the member to delete. The system will display the tooltip **Delete** when moving the mouse on the 'Delete' icon in the action column.

Note: The 'Remove' button will be disabled, not allowing deletion of one's own account.

The user clicks on the 'Delete' icon, the system will open a confirmation pop-up window in the center of the screen.

**Step 2** :

_Member Removal Success Notice!_

Members will be **removed** members from the app, but their account will remain the same and not show up in the list of members.

However, if necessary, admins can still invite members whose membership has been removed to rejoin.

## Account disqualified

If a member is in an app and someone else removes their membership, the system checks and performs the following steps:

1. Display a 403 message that says:

> Sorry, you don't have permission to access this page.

Users can click the 'About Overview' button to return to the app list. The app doesn't show up in the user's list of apps because there's no access.
