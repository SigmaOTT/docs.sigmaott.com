# Update your membership

**Condition**: There must be at least one other member and be displayed in the member list.

After inviting a member, the admin wants to change the member's enforcement permissions, and so the admin needs to update the member's permissions again.

Interface at the member list:

**Step 1**: The user clicks on the 'edit' icon in the action column.

Display a **Edit Member** window:

![Edit member](/images/streaming-platform/app-management/02-member/pop-up/edit.png)

- **Name**: User email - no corrections allowed.
- **Permission groups**: A list of currently selected permission groups.

**Step 2**: Click on 'permission group' or you can quickly create one according to the instructions [here](.. /03-group/b-create.md#create-group).

Click the 'Save' button.

**Step 3**: Record the permission change and display the message:

! [Successful member edit] (/images/streaming-platform/app-management/02-member/message/edit.png)

_Notice: Member edit successful!_

## Member Account

After the administrator updates the permissions, the member account will be updated and displayed:

1. Display the sidebar according to allowed permissions.
2. Display the Dashboard by permissions.
