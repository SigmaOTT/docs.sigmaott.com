# Edit a group

Condition: The group was created earlier and is already visible in the group list.

Adjustments during group editing will affect the group's own information and will be displayed in the **Invite Members** pop-up.

Members with access to the management app can make adjustments on group selections, even if the group is active.

**Step 1**:

At the main screen, users can make edits by moving their mouse on the 'Edit' icon in the 'actions' column corresponding to the desired group.

**Step 2:**
When the user clicks on the 'edit' icon, the system displays a pop-up **Edit Group** in the middle of the screen, displaying the previously selected information.

**Step 3:**
After the user makes changes and presses the 'Save' button, the system will automatically save the newly updated information. A successful update message will appear at the top of the screen, and after that, the window will automatically close after 5 seconds.

## Team members

After editing the group, members assigned to the group will lose access to the system. In this scenario, a UI 403 error page will be displayed to inform about not having access.

Users can click the 'About Overview' button to return to the app list, and the sidebar shows only products that have access.
