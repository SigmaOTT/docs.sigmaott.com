## Manage folder mechanisms to monitor

Allows users to create conditions of folders that can be tracked according to a certain mechanism. Any file uploaded that meets the conditions of this directory will automatically trigger transcoding

When the system detects a change in the directory (e.g. new file created, file edited, or file deleted), it automatically triggers the related job. This can be an automated process or a series of predefined actions, such as processing, reprocessing, sending notifications, or performing any other task related to this change.

## Simulate live stream via VOD (Pseudo-live streaming)

Different from the transmission of live and actual content, pseudo-live streaming creates an experience that resembles watching a live broadcast despite the fact that it is played from a previously recorded video source.

**Topic:**

## Batch Job transcode

If you want to migrate multiple resources that are stored on a server or other source and these resources are publicly accessible, creating each job takes time. Therefore, to optimize time for users, we support moving resources by batches. In this way, you can quickly transcode a large number of files with n jobs output and reduce traffic usage.
