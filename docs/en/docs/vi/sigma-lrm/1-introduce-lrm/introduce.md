# Introduction of LRM-Sigma Linear Right Management

With the popularity of IP-supported devices, consumers are able to access content anywhere, at any time, and the demand is increasing. Thus, TV programming and TV services, distributors are attempting to develop more personalized video, distributed through various channels to operators, **offers a maximum amount of** but still **to comply with the distribution of** and local regulations (television distributors). To address this challenge we launch the LRM-Sigma Linear Right Management solution. The Sigma Linear Right Management system **provides a comprehensive** solution that supports **control of direct content or VOD** to each customer object in cases **loss of signal, loss of** and **limiting the device**.


## What is online wave management software?

LRM-Sigma Linear Right Management is a  **software that address the growing** complexity of **accurately distributed**, the right and content expressed through the system of mobile screens and live multi-channel broadcasts.

Not only ensures that the content is transmitted by **to the right object** at the right time, it works to clarify your events and work processes:
 * Providing clear tools,
 * It &apos; s simple to be able to adjust the schedule.
 * Schedule a publishing schedule for individual needs of each and every device.

The system supports 2 methods of content control including:
- Managing **by channel**: Supporting the Transcoder and Packager to integrate the ESAM protocol
- Managing **by User**: When using the same Sigma DAI solution (Dynamic Ads Insert)

## Active LRM
Based on **Replace 1 content timeshift** according to the EPG-Electronic Program Guide process or **in a predetermined time of** with visual content, video.

## Process
The input stream to the channel signal is ingest from the Thudo JSC system, which provides a linear IP data source for the LRM API through multiple formats supported by both the programmer and the operator through the LRM service entering the data and standardization it into SCTE 224 format stored locally. Then, it is distributed to many end points of the distribution partner and the data is displayed to the viewer (output) below:
* Format **UDP/ HLS**,
* **Profiles**: 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p,
* **Watermark**: Logo by each partner.

## Benefits
The LRM solution is not a completely new solution, has been developed abroad as PRISMA-MediaKind, COMCAST TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS. But in Vietnam there are local regulations and need to comply with different rights distributions, **being the first and only unit in Vietnam** to develop LRM solution, which is why our solution is more appropriate. The development of a solution is always giving to the users of the benefits:

* Provide alternative content options in cases of loss of signal, loss of content and device restrictions.
* Ensure that the alternate content is conveyed to the correct object at the right time.
* LRM works to clarify your events and work processes-providing clear, simple tools that can adjust the schedule, schedule a publishing schedule for editors, individual needs of each and each device.
* Users use the LRM dashboard to view all event data, specify a program space, optional content to edit/expand the event in real time and verify the appropriate alternative content.
* Automatic control of the schedule into the operator's programmable electronic programming (EPG) process.
* Provides a single source of data management for both the programmer and the operator through the synthesis of SCTE 224 events.

## Destination

* This document is built for the manual work that uses the details of the operation of software functions.
* The content presents in the brief document, according to the sequence of functions and instructions that each step by step. Thus, users easily use the program through this document.

This system was built to support the editor:

* Edit channels, manage channels

* Edit and track events that take place, configure the timeshift content,

* Date of publication, scheduling the content of Live Stream content.

The CMS is built on the VTVcab ON app. In the updated version, CMS is improved for easier use, more intuitive.

* The browser can be used to edit **Web desktop**: Includes popular browsers such as Chrome, Cup, Fire Fox, Opera, Microsoft Edge, Safari. However, we propose to use the browser **Chrome.**

*Some other tasks:*
 * Manage distribution channel for partner
 * Scheduling a live stream content replacement
 * Configure the timeshift content
 * Ingest channels are distributed to themselves.
 * Pull your timeshift content.
 * There are basic functions of the program: loginn, logout, password change, processing of career processes.
