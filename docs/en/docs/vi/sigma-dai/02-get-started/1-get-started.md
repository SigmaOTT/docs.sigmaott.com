# Starting with SSAI
To use SSAi, you need to have your account and access, see and execute the permitted actions.
## Channel settings
To set up the channel you need to prepare the following tasks:
* Prepare your HLS or DASH content stream.
* Configure the video content source (video content source) and advertising server (ADS).
* Create an SSAI configuration that contains a rebroadcast endpoint.
* Use your browser or content distribution network (CDN) to send a return request to SSAI (not required). When completed, you will be able to send a rebroadcast request to SSAI for personalized advertising content in your flow.
