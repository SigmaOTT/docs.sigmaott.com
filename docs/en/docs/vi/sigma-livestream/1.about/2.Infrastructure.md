# Infrastructure of Sigma Live Streaming System


![About-2](/images/livestream-about-2.png)



## Broadcaster

Sigma live stream platform has sdk support for platforms such as android, ios with important features:

* AAC audio encoding, H. 264 video encoding (supports soft/hard editing, supports baseline/main/high profile)

* Multi-resolution encoding support

* Camera control (heading, flash, front and rear camera)

* Adaptively adjust the bit rate of the video according to the network bandwidth, the network adaptive mode can be configured.

* Support RTMP protocol live streaming

* Support encode video in low latency mode



## Viewer playback

On mobile devices using the android and ios operating system, Sigma live stream platform support player playback:

* Plugin SDK for Exoplayer (revised version 2.6 or above)

* Plugin SDK for AVPlayer

* Support Low Latency HLS

* Preview thumbnail in livestream

* Support livestream DVR

* Support ABR (Adaptive bitrate) for Low Latency HLS

  * **Setting a suitable initial start position**: Select the desired start time to be able to have the lowest latency delay with direct flow. For example in the ultra low latency mode, the system starts the flow rate at 3 seconds late than live.
  * **Adjusting the playback speed**: The speed of the flow is well-adjusted between 0.8-1.2 so that the viewer does not detect the change. The goal to extend the buffer of the broadcast stream reaches the desired lag.



## RTMP Server

The RTMP Server system is divided by the region to connect with the fastest broadcast possible, with scale automation, the system that can handle thousands of connections.

## S-Transcoder

* Support for transmux & transcode channel live stream with low latency, high performance

* Transcode resolution up to UltraHD (4K)

* Full Resolution Control: resize, crop, letterbox, and more

* Adjustable aspect ratio of the output video

* Video Filters: Rotate, Denoise, Deinterlace, sharpen, autolevel, deblock, flip, mirror

* Audio Controls: Normalize, Gain, Equalize, Fade-in, Fade-out, Karaoke, Advanced Audio Levels Control

* Advanced Audio Resampling

* Conditional Outputs (min/max size and duration)

* Support mode zero latency for optimization encoding time



## Api Server

Api Server system provides API communication with App Server live stream:

* Management of livestream event (create, update, remove ...)
* Management of livestream asset (DVR, catchup, thumbnail ... )
* Webhook livestream event



## Monitor

  * Follow the system through important parameters.
  * Warning when the system meets the incident

- **Stream data stream from**:

  1. System login and request for stream generation

  2. Biosystem and returns **RTMP Server** (corresponding to the location of the source) and **token** authentication source

  3. Start streaming **RTMP Server**

  4. **RTMP Server** authentication is based on metadata update token on the channel list

  5. Interact with the viewer



- **Data stream from viewer**:

  1. System login, which lists either the broadcast list or has been consistent (based on the geographical location, the channel's priority, the channels already like …)

  2. Select the channel to see

  3. The Edge server return system (CDN) is consistent with the viewer

  4. View the channel and interact (chat, send …)
