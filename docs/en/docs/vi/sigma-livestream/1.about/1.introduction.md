- **78% viewer** are already watching live video on Facebook live.

- **82% viewer** prefer live video from a brand to social posts.

*"I think it takes more than three seconds to build your brand, and conquers are willing to spend the time if your content is compatible, relevant, and valid." - [Momentology](http://www.momentology.com/8936-video-marketing-trends-2016/)*



## What make a live stream success?

What guarantees the success of a live stream stream?

For a direct stream, the signal ensures that success is the content that the supplier creates towards the most desired object. The growth of the number of viewers in response to the success of the live stream. To ensure that success in addition to the broadcast of the broadcaster, the live stream technology platform played a very important role.

62% of consumers are more likely to have a negative perception of a brand with a low-quality video experience. - [KZO](https://kzoinnovations.com/video-quality-influence-brand-perception)

The quality of service when broadcasting plays an extremely important role in the emotions of the viewer. In addition, the broadcaster's channels are interned with the user (example: Q&A, play the game with the viewer ...) It &apos; s always top-top channels on online services. For direct interaction with the latency users of the content transmission system to the viewer that affects them.



*Since we started providing our player for apps 15 years ago, video streaming on mobile devices has been carried out. Many people now respect to access the same content on multiple devices with broadcast quality, whether they are at home or on the go. "*

*"Having a multiscreen low latency solution is a top reaction for customers and opens the door for fascinating interactive use cases, leveraging the best end-to-end technology and synchronization of the stream among all end users."*

*Carlos Lucas, General Manager of NexPlayer at* *NextStreaming*



## Key drivers of low latency for video streaming

Early streaming formats, prime developed for SVOD, focus on avoiding re-buffering when rendering video on a player. But to make that work everywhere on any device, memory buffers had to be used in the workflow, especially in the player. This contains to the success of OTT but also introduced end-to-end latency. For example, Apple's original HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol, released in 2009, recommended using 10-second segments and specifically that players should not buffer less than three segments. This explains why many OTT services show a typical latency of 40 seconds or even more. Apple later revised its recommendation to six-second segments, but this still equals to 18 seconds of delay just on the client side to be HLS compliant.

With a 20-40 second delay or more, it is not a problem for users to see VOD. But for the immediate event that the overpass is too high will affect the interaction between the viewer and the broadcaster. The image below shows the impact of latency and the components that generate latency when convex content.

## Sigma Live Stream Platform

### Introduction Description of system

The Sigma Live Stream platform allows users to provide content from any device to any desired device. The most important point of the project is to create a platform that supports the user of the action to become a single-simplest broadcaster. Supports multiple technological solutions for the player and the viewer. The player may choose the transfer delay to pull closer than the viewer. The viewer will not have to miss any moment in the live event.

### Feature

- Digital processing **transmux & transcode** live stream channels
- Manage content during and after live stream streams end
  - **Livestream DVR** (review the content that had previously been on live stream)
  - **Source Record** (Save Source file)
  - **Catchup**
  - **Thumbnail** (Automated automatic thumbnail, livestream support preview for both live stream and review)

- Implement Low Latency HLS (with Ultra Low Latency mode)
- Select multiple live modes
  - **Normal latency** : reduced viewer playback buffering.
    - Choose "Normal latency" if you don't plan to interact with your audience. This is the highest quality setting for viewers since it has the lowest amount of viewer buffering.
    - Latency: ~ 20-30 seconds
  - **Low latency**: near real-time time interactivity
    - Choose this option if you want low latency with minimal viewer buffering. This setting is a good balance between the other two options.
    - Latency: ~ 8-10 seconds
  - **Ultra low latency**: highly interactive live streams with real-time management
    - Choose this option if you want to maximize management with your audience and don't mind increasing the chance that your viewers may bug more.
    - Latency: ~ 2-4 seconds
- Monitor, Alert & Analytic live stream metrics
  - Health check system
  - Alert when system has proven
  - Backup livestream when system fail
  - Analyst live stream metrics:
    - CCU
    - Total view
    - Total Time watch
- The system is highly available, easily deployed ...
- Optik of resources and expenses
- API is simple, easy to use and integrated with every system
  - Api with secure token
  - Webhook for live stream event
