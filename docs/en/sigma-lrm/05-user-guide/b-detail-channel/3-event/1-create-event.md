## Create a new scheduling event

For cases where you only need to change the content within a specific time period, creating a new event is appropriate. However, in cases where events repeat over multiple days, editing each individual event can be time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, you can choose a scheduling publishing type to make it convenient for CMS users to set time and manage built-in video editors.

### Advantage

Compared to Overlay scheduling, when a user successfully creates an event using the new scheduling function, the event will immediately appear on the timeline with a status of **Preparing** making it easy for users to track and observe.

### Mode of operation

Event scheduling: Consists of one or more events that are configured based on the interval and displayed at configured intervals.

The system supports 2 methods:

- Alternate Content (Blackout) scheduling for all or some pre-installed partners.
- Schedule wave blocking manually or from a pre-marked EPG.

### Configure scheduling events

Editorial content scheduling is important in your channel's event strategy, so curating and scheduling editorials requires care. Watch schedules help plan content on the channel become scientific and effective. By using scheduling, CMS users can maintain accuracy and ensure that editorial content is published at the right time for an audience.

**Step 2**: Select the publishing type as **Scheduling**

The system displays additional fields in a drop-down list.
