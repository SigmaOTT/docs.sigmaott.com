## What is a session?

After the channel is initialized, the user can push the input stream and the session is automatically assigned with an 'init' state, ending when the session runs at the end of its duration (timeout) or the user actively stops the channel. Keeping sessions running continuously can help create continuity in the viewing experience and keep your audience constantly interested in the content and avoid overload.

A livestream channel has multiple sessions assigned. Changes to each session's channel information may vary, depending on the channel's edit update history.

The session is unique, when the session ends, cannot be reused, the newly born session continues to operate the task.
