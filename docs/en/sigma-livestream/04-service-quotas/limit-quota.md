# Usage Limitations

Quotas are set up to ensure that the website operates efficiently, prevent simultaneous access by multiple users or reduce the risk of server overload, and protect server resources from abuse.

In a website, a quota is used to describe a limit or restriction on the use of a specific amount of resources. These resources may include hosting, the number of simultaneous live streaming channels, sessions, or any resources that the website makes available to users.

### Purpose

To determine resource limits, the number of simultaneous live streaming channels within the range of packages used by the user. When the user reaches the resource limit, the system blocks the right to push input into the channel to start streaming directly into the system service, ensuring that they cannot continue using the free service until the App is upgraded or the resource limit is expanded.

The blocking of the Livestream service must be enforced by the system to ensure that users cannot use the product or service beyond the Pro App limit.

### Scope

Resource limits are independent between apps in the same account. That is, with account A:

Application 1 reaches the quota limit → runs out of resources used, update to continue using.

App 2 has not reached the quota limit → continue to use it.
