## Ad insert endpoint

An ad insert endpoint brings together your source manifests into a linear flow. Each ad insert endpoint contains one or more outputs that correspond to your package configuration.

First, you create an ad insert endpoint, and then add VOD sources and direct sources to your ad insert endpoint's schedule by creating a program. Each program is associated with a VOD source or a direct source.
