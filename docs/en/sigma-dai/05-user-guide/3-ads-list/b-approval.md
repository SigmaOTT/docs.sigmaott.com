# Censor

After the ad is transcoded and eligible for insertion, the ad is inserted. Wishing to more strictly manage the ad insertion feature, the system supports moderation features, managed according to 2 features:

## App moderation

**Condition**:

- Default when accessing the app for the first time: turning off auto approval.
- There is already an ad insert endpoint created and containing it.
- At least 1 ad has been created.

Function Description:

- Not-approve:

  - Function: Hide the entire switch moderation feature of the ad list.
  - By default, all ads are inserted, independent of moderation.
  - New ads are created → the default initialization status is enabled = approval ( under BE) but hidden ( UI side).

- Approve:
  - Functionality: Allows active moderation of all ads.
  - Ad insertion depends on the app's moderation status.
